## About Me

I am a full-stack software developer based in Turkey. I love writing code and am friendly, open-minded and easy to work with. I love challenges and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I am okay working under pressure and good at managing a crisis. I speak English, Turkish and French.

### What I do

I mainly write server-side logic in typescript, when I have to, I also do other stuff.
