## About Me

I am a full-stack software developer based in Turkey. I love writing code and am friendly, open-minded and easy to work with. I love challenges and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I am okay working under pressure and good at managing a crisis. I speak English, Turkish and French.

## About The Work I Do

I mainly focus on optimisation techniques, fail-safe design and reactive auto-scaling for I specialise in writing software that is meant to be deployed to environements which are expected to be hostile in terms of security or highly stressfull in terms of data traffic, meaning I expect my deployment to recieve large volumes of input in a short amount of time, I expect my deployment to be attacked by malicious actors and I expect both of these things to be happening at the same time, all the time. My goal is to provide 100% uptime no matter what. I am also a huge fan of functional programming and I try to use it as much as possible. Moreover I prefer to use the most appropriate tool for the job, meaning I am not afraid to use a language or a framework that is not popular or widely used. I make effort to deliver the best high availability, fault tolerance and low latency in all my work and will often use formal methods to prove the correctness of my algorithms. Im also okay at networking and have experience with nftables and nginx to do filtering, load balancing and caching. I also provide consulting and RnD services for companies and individuals. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
